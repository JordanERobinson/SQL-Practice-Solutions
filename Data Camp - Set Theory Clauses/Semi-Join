You are now going to use the concept of a semi-join to identify languages spoken in the Middle East.

Part 1
Begin by selecting all country codes in the Middle East as a single field result using SELECT, FROM, and WHERE.

-- Select code
Select code
  -- From countries
  From countries
-- Where region is Middle East
Where region = 'Middle East';

Part 2


    Below the commented code, select only unique languages by name appearing in the languages table.
    Order the resulting single field table by name in ascending order.


/*
SELECT code
  FROM countries
WHERE region = 'Middle East';
*/

-- Select field
Select distinct name
  -- From languages
  From languages
-- Order by name
Order by name;

Part 3


    Combine the previous two queries into one query by adding a WHERE IN statement to the 
    SELECT DISTINCT query to determine the unique languages spoken in the Middle East.
    Order the result by name in ascending order.

-- Query from step 2
SELECT DISTINCT name
  FROM languages
-- Where in statement
Where code IN
  -- Query from step 1
  -- Subquery
  (SELECT code
   FROM countries
   WHERE region = 'Middle East') 
-- Order by name
Order by name;
