Problem

Using the countries table, create a new field AS geosize_group that groups the countries into three groups:

    If surface_area is greater than 2 million, geosize_group is 'large'.
    If surface_area is greater than 350 thousand but not larger than 2 million, geosize_group is 'medium'.
    Otherwise, geosize_group is 'small'.

Solution

~~
SELECT name, continent, code, surface_area,
    -- First case
    CASE WHEN surface_area > 2000000 THEN 'large'
        -- Second case
        WHEN surface_area > 350000 THEN 'medium'
        -- Else clause + end
        ELSE 'small' END
        -- Alias name
        AS geosize_group
-- From table
FROM countries;
