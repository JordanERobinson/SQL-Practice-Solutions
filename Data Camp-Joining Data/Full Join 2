You'll now investigate a similar exercise to the last one, but this time focused on using a table with more records on the left than the right. 
You'll work with the languages and countries tables.

Begin with a full join with languages on the left and countries on the right. Appropriate fields have been selected for you again here.

Part 1

    Choose records in which countries.name starts with the capital letter 'V' or is NULL.
    Arrange by countries.name in ascending order to more clearly see the results.

~~
  Attempt 1: forgot % in where clause
SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
-- From languages
FROM languages
  -- Join to countries
  FULL JOIN countries
    -- Match on code
    USING (code)
-- Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V' OR countries.name IS null
-- Order by ascending countries.name
ORDER BY countries.name;

  Attempt 2: correct
SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
-- From languages
FROM languages
  -- Join to countries
  FULL JOIN countries
    -- Match on code
    USING (code)
-- Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS null
-- Order by ascending countries.name
ORDER BY countries.name;

~~

Part 2


    Repeat the same query as before, using a LEFT JOIN instead of a FULL JOIN. Note what has changed compared to the FULL JOIN result!

SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
-- From languages
FROM languages
  -- Join to countries
  LEFT JOIN countries
    -- Match on code
    USING (code)
-- Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS NULL
-- Order by ascending countries.name
ORDER BY countries.name;

Part 3

Repeat once more, but use an INNER JOIN instead of a LEFT JOIN. Note what has changed compared to the FULL JOIN and LEFT JOIN results.

SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
-- From languages
FROM languages
  -- Join to countries
  INNER JOIN countries
    -- Match using code
    USING (code)
-- Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS NULL
-- Order by ascending countries.name
ORDER BY countries.name;
