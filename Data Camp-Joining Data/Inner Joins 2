    Specify the field to match the tables ON.
    From this join, SELECT:
        c.code, aliased as country_code.

-- Select fields with aliases
SELECT c.code AS country_code, name, year, inflation_rate
FROM countries AS c
  -- Join to economies (alias e)
  INNER JOIN economies AS e
    -- Match on code
    ON c.code = e.code;
